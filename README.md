# Neighborhood Map

## About

Project #5 of the Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree. This project involves developing a single page application using various APIs. In this particular project, I used the Google Maps API to build a map with several location markers. I also implemented Wiki API to provide an article on each location.

This is a map of several popular resorts in Reno, Nevada.
